# EPCT - Explore Plan Code Test

Systematic development workflow for high-quality code delivery.

## Process

**Explore** the codebase and requirements in parallel subagents.
**Plan** the implementation with detailed architecture thinking.
**Code** incrementally with continuous validation.
**Test** comprehensively and iterate until all tests pass.

## Execution Steps

1. **Explore Phase**
   - Analyze existing codebase structure and patterns
   - Understand requirements and dependencies
   - Identify integration points and constraints
   - Review related documentation and examples

2. **Plan Phase**
   - Design solution architecture and approach
   - Break down into implementable components
   - Define interfaces and data structures
   - Plan testing strategy and validation approach

3. **Code Phase**
   - Implement incrementally following planned architecture
   - Apply appropriate coding standards and best practices
   - Run formatters and linters after each component
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge cases

4. **Test Phase**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Create integration tests where needed
   - Run all tests and validate functionality
   - Fix any issues and re-test until green
   - Update documentation as needed

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass (green status)
- Code follows project standards and best practices
- Implementation matches planned architecture
- Documentation is updated appropriately
- No linting or formatting issues remain

Execute this workflow systematically, taking time for proper analysis and planning before rushing to implementation.
